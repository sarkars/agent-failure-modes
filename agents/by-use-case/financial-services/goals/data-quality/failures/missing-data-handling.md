# Missing Data Mishandling in Financial Models

## Issue: Model Handles Missing Data Incorrectly (Mean Imputation, Deletion); Introduces Bias or Information Loss

**Frequency**: Common

**Symptoms**
- Financial data has gaps (no trading on weekends, holiday closures)
- Model imputes mean price → Artificially smooth volatility
- Model deletes rows with missing data → Survivor bias
- Forward-fill creates lookahead bias

**Root Cause**
Missing data is inherent in time series (no trading on holidays). Naive imputation (mean, forward-fill) has serious consequences. Mean imputation reduces volatility unrealistically. Forward-fill uses future data. Deletion introduces survivor bias. No unified "right" way; context matters.

**Example**
```
Scenario: Trading model trained on stock prices
Data: Monday-Friday trading prices
Weekend/Holiday: No trading (prices missing Saturday-Sunday)
Naive handling: Forward-fill (Friday price = Saturday price = Sunday price)
Result: Continuous time series but artificial (weekends have zero volatility)
Model learns: "Volatility is lower than reality"
Forward testing: Actual weekend returns volatile (market opens with gap)
Impact: Model underestimates risk; position sizing too aggressive
```

**Key Statistics**
- Data completeness: 80-95% typical (weekends, holidays missing)
- Volatility reduction by mean imputation: 10-30%
- Lookahead bias from careless forward-fill: 1-3% annual return bias

## Mitigation Strategies

### Prevention

1. **Implement multi-layer entity resolution with hierarchy validation**: Maintain a master entity reference database with parent-subsidiary relationships, guaranteed updater, transaction account mappings. Use persistent unique identifiers (LEI, ISIN, internal ID) instead of name-based matching. On every exposure lookup, resolve through hierarchy graph and validate against current regulatory filings. Root cause: Ensures exposure always attributed to correct legal entity accounting for corporate structure changes.

2. **Establish regulatory compliance gates with before/after checks**: Before any trading decision or exposure update, verify: (1) Counterparty regulatory status (sanctions check, credit rating current), (2) Position size vs. single-name concentration limit at ultimate parent level, (3) Exposure vs. concentration risk limits across correlated counterparties. Abort if any gate fails. Root cause: Prevents trades that violate compliance rules by checking compliance before execution.

3. **Implement market data freshness validation with latency bounds**: Every market data feed includes timestamp. Before using data for decisions, verify: (1) Timestamp within acceptable age (e.g., <30s for prices, <1d for ratings), (2) Data not marked as stale by upstream provider, (3) Cross-feed consistency check (e.g., bid-ask spread reasonable). Reject stale/inconsistent data with alert. Root cause: Prevents decisions based on outdated market information.

### Detection & Response

1. **Exposure aggregation audit with parent-level rollup**: Daily batch job re-computes all exposure aggregations at ultimate parent level from scratch (not incremental). Compares against operational system. Flags: (1) Missing hierarchy mappings, (2) Exposure misattributed to legal entity instead of parent, (3) Concentration violations only visible at parent level. Reports with detailed reconciliation.

2. **Regulatory compliance violation detection**: Monitor all executed trades against post-hoc compliance checks. Flag violations: (1) Counterparty now in breach of sanctions/credit triggers after trade, (2) Concentration limit exceeded at parent level, (3) Position size violates regulatory limits for entity type. Generate audit trail for each violation with decision data.

### Architecture Patterns

1. Corporate Hierarchy Graph Service: Maintains versioned parent-subsidiary-guarantee relationships. API: resolve_to_parent(entity_id, as_of_date) -> parent_id + risk_correlation. Fetches from regulatory filings (daily), M&A feeds (real-time), credit data (weekly). Triggers recomputation on family structure changes. Serves through cache with fallback to DB.

2. Pre-Trade Compliance Engine: Rule engine evaluates every proposed trade against: sanctions checks, concentration limits (computed at parent + correlated entities), regulatory position size limits, data freshness gates. Blocks non-compliant trades with detailed audit log of which rule failed why.

3. Market Data Freshness Orchestrator: Aggregates feeds from multiple market data providers with explicit 'as of' timestamps. Computes data freshness for each field (bid, ask, last_traded, credit_spread). Feeds below threshold age marked as 'stale'. Risk system rejects decisions using stale feeds with incident log.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Parent-Level Aggregation Accuracy | >99.5% | <99% | Percentage of counterparty exposure correctly rolled up to ultimate parent vs. attributed to legal entity only |
| Hierarchy Graph Staleness (Post-Restructuring) | <7 days | >14 days | Max time between corporate restructuring announcement and hierarchy graph update for known counterparties |
| Compliance Gate Pass Rate | 99.9% | <99.5% | Percentage of proposed trades passing all pre-trade compliance checks |
| Market Data Freshness Compliance | >98% | <95% | Percentage of market data points within acceptable age bounds before use in decisions |
| Post-Trade Violation Detection Rate | >95% | <90% | Percentage of actual compliance violations caught by post-trade audit vs. total violations |

### Alerts & Escalation

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Parent-Level Concentration Breach | Ultimate parent exposure exceeds concentration limit while legal-entity-level exposures individually within limits | CRITICAL | Halt new trades to counterparty family; escalate to risk committee; generate audit report |
| Stale Hierarchy on Restructuring | Known M&A/spin-off event affecting held counterparty with no hierarchy update >7 days | HIGH | Page data team; trigger priority hierarchy refresh; mark affected counterparties for manual review |
| Stale Market Data in Decision | Market data >30s old used for pricing decision, or >1d old used for risk assessment | HIGH | Reject decision; alert trader; log incident with full decision trace for audit |
