# Follow-Up Context Loss

## Issue: Agent Doesn't Maintain Context Across Conversation Turns

**Frequency**: Common

**Symptoms**
- Pronouns not resolved from previous turns
- Topic switches not detected
- Previous answers not built upon
- User must re-explain context each turn

**Root Cause**
RAG retrieval happens per-turn without incorporating conversation history. Follow-up queries lack context for proper retrieval.

**Example**
```
Turn 1: "What are the features of Product X?"
Agent: [Good answer about Product X features]

Turn 2: "How much does it cost?"
Query sent to retrieval: "How much does it cost?"

Missing context: "it" = Product X

Retrieved: Generic pricing documentation
Agent: "Pricing varies by product. Which product are you interested in?"

Result: Context lost, user frustrated by repetition
```

**Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Query rewriting**: Resolve pronouns before retrieval
2. **Conversation memory**: Include relevant history in context
3. **Topic tracking**: Maintain current topic state
4. **Coreference resolution**: Explicitly resolve "it", "this", "that"
5. **Session-aware retrieval**: Filter by session context
6. **History summarization**: Compress relevant history into query

**Detection**
- Track pronoun usage in follow-up queries
- Monitor context-loss related clarifications
- Measure answer quality degradation over turns
- Identify topic continuity breaks


## Mitigation Strategies

### Prevention

1. **Implement query-answer consistency validation**: Decompose complex queries into atomic components and verify each component is addressed in the answer before returning. Use RAGAS Answer Relevancy metric (target: >0.75) with automatic re-generation for scores below threshold. Root cause mitigation: Prevents context-anchoring by explicitly binding answer generation to parsed query intent.

2. **Apply multi-source consensus verification**: Require answers synthesized from multiple sources to explicitly cite which sources support each claim and flag unresolved contradictions. Implementation: Use semantic similarity checks across source fragments to detect cherry-picked evidence patterns. Root cause: Ensures balanced representation of evidence when sources conflict.

3. **Enforce comprehensive coverage checks**: Implement structured extraction requiring explicit treatment of caveats, limitations, exceptions, and counterevidence for each claim type. Use template responses with mandatory caveat sections. Root cause: Prevents omission of qualifying information that would change user decision-making.

### Detection & Response

1. **Answer completeness monitoring**: Measure coverage of query intents in generated answers. Track query decomposition rate (% of query components explicitly addressed) and flag responses with coverage <85%. Instrument RAG pipeline to log query-answer similarity scores per component. Alert on sustained scores <0.70.

2. **Evidence balance scoring**: For each answer, compute evidence distribution across sources and flag one-sided responses (>70% from single source on multi-source queries). Implement automated extraction of caveat/limitation mentions and track inclusion rates by query type. Target: >80% of medical/financial answers include relevant caveats.

### Architecture Patterns

1. Query Intent Decomposition Graph: Parse complex queries into a DAG of atomic intents before retrieval. Each retrieved document is mapped to specific intent nodes. Answer generation must satisfy all leaf nodes. Validation layer computes coverage before response generation.

2. Evidence Consensus Engine: Maintain a fact graph where each claim is attributed to specific sources with confidence scores. Multi-source claims require consensus computation (intersection of sources supporting claim). Flagging layer surfaces contradictions to generation model.

3. Structured Response Templates: Use task-specific response schemas that enforce inclusion of: primary answer, supporting evidence, relevant caveats/exceptions, alternative interpretations, confidence bounds. Auto-flag template violations before user delivery.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Answer Relevancy Score | >0.75 | <0.70 | RAGAS metric on generated answers vs. original query |
| Query Coverage Rate | >90% | <85% | Percentage of query components explicitly addressed in answer |
| Evidence Balance Index | >0.6 | <0.4 | Distribution of citations across sources (Gini coefficient, 0=balanced, 1=single-source) |
| Caveat Inclusion Rate | >80% | <70% | Percentage of medical/financial answers including relevant limitations |
| User Clarification Rate | <5% | >10% | Percentage of answered queries requiring follow-up clarification |

### Alerts & Escalation

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Low Answer Relevancy | Answer Relevancy Score < 0.70 for >5% of queries in 1-hour window | HIGH | Page on-call; trigger re-generation with query reinforcement prompt |
| Single-Source Dominance | Evidence Balance Index < 0.4 on multi-source queries for >3 consecutive queries | MEDIUM | Log event; audit cherry-picking patterns in retrieval/synthesis |
| Rising Clarification Demand | User Clarification Rate exceeds 10% (vs. 5% baseline) over 24-hour window | HIGH | Investigate query decomposition or answer template effectiveness |
